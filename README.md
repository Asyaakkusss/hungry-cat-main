# Welcome to Tomato Paws!

Hi! This is the user manual/README for the tomato paws application. After each sprint, this manual will be updated to explain how to run the application and use its components. 

# Running the Project 

In order to run the project, please follow these steps. 

1. Clone the repository using ```git clone *github key*```. Navigate to the ```master``` branch. 
2. Create two terminal instances in your IDE of choice. 
3. In one of the terminals, run ```node C:\path\to\your\server.js```. Please find your own unique path to the server.js file in the Tomato Paws application and use that in place of the arbitrary file string used as a placeholder in the previous sentence. This will start the API and server that is necessary to run the application. It will be viewable in the ```localhost:8080``` tab on your machine. You do not have to explicitly open this page in order to run and view the application, but you are welcome to do so if you are curious. 
4. In the other terminal, run ```npm start```. This will start the application in the ```localhost:3000``` tab on your machine. If you are not redirected to this tab, please type it into your browser and the application should appear.
